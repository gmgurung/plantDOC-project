                I am Manish Gurung, and I am from Nepal. I am studying Data Science with a minor in Project Management at Drexel. My hobbies include playing and watching Soccer/Football and outdoor recreational activities like hiking, mountain biking, etc. I also love to travel, and once I graduate, I would like to get a remote job and travel the world while maintaining a job. Currently, I am trying to get more into different frameworks and try my hand at data analysis with software management. I am not into writing millions and millions of lines of code; that is why I want to become a geek who can automate most of the work and deal with analytics, testing or management work rather than code myself away.
